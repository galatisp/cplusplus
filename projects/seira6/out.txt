Once upon a time in China, some believe, around the year one
double-ought three, head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai
Mei was walking down the road, contemplating whatever it  is
thata man of Pai Mei's infinite power contemplates  -  which
isanother way of saying "who knows" - when  a  Shaolin  monk
appeared, traveling in the opposite direction.  As  themonk
andthe priest crossed  paths,  Pai  Mei,  in  a  practically
unfathomabledisplay  of  generosity,  gave  the   monk   the
slightestof nods. The nod was not returned.
